METAGENOME ASSEMBLY USING SPAdes

Installation in Linux Environment
1.1.1.1. Open the Command Prompt window.
1.1.1.2. Download the SPAdes programme using the following command: 
wget https://github.com/ablab/spades/releases/download/v3.15.3/SPAdes-3.15.3-Linux.tar.gz 
1.1.1.3. Unpack the tar folder to access SPAdes
tar xzvf SPAdes-3.15.3-Linux.tar.gz
1.1.1.4. Add the SPAdes script to your designated PATH (this allows the server to easily access the programme without having to manually indicate where it is)
1.1.1.4.1. Change directory into the folder containing the SPAdes programme and the bin directory
cd Tools/SPAdes-3.15.3-Linux/bin
1.1.1.4.2. View the contents of the folder using the ls command, which should contain a number of files, including a “spades.py” script
1.1.1.4.3. View the full path to where the SPAdes programme is stored using the pwd command, and copy this path.
1.1.1.5. Return to the home directory using the cd command
1.1.1.6. Open your bash profile (a file containing all the settings necessary for running the different programmes in your profile)
nano ~/.bashrc 
1.1.1.7. Scroll to the bottom of the file, above the line with a bunch of code for initializing Conda and copy this command: 
export PATH=$PATH:/home/sam/Tools/SPAdes-3.15.5-Linux/bin
1.1.1.8. Save your changes by typing ‘Ctrl+O’ and <Enter>, then exit the file by typing ‘Ctrl+X’ and <Enter>.
1.1.1.9. Confirm that spades is running 
1.1.1.9.1. Refresh the bash profile
source ~/.bashrc
1.1.1.9.2. Run the programme 
which spades.py
* The path to spades should be visible if running correctly (e.g. /home/gabby/Tools/SPAdes-3.15.3-Linux/bin)
1.1.2. Assembly of marine invertebrate metagenomes
1.1.2.1. Enter the Slurm_scripts folder using the cd command
e.g. /home/gabby/Slurm_scripts
1.1.2.2. Create a new file in the Slurm_scripts folder
nano spades_iontorrent.sh
1.1.2.3. Rename the script according to the name of the metagenome being assembled (e.g. for sample TIC2019-013N, name the script 013N_spades_iontorrent.sh),
1.1.2.4. Modify the script in 4.4.4.3 to indicate the number of CPUs needed, path to the folder where your sequence reads are stored and output folder location.
The script should look like the screenshot below
- path/to/your/reads should be the full path to where the raw reads are store (e.g. /home/gabby/Assembly_directory/)
- the ‘XXX’ in IonCode_XXX_rawlib.basecaller.bam should be replaced with the filename containing your raw sequences (e.g. IonCode_0663_rawlib.basecaller.bam)

1.1.2.5. Run the SPAdes programme.
sbatch spades_iontorrent.sh
1.1.2.6. Check the status of the job using the squeue command.
Squeue
