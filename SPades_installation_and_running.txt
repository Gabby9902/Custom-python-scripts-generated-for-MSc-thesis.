METAGENOME ASSEMBLY USING SPAdes

A. Installation in Linux Environment
Open the Command Prompt window.

Download the SPAdes programme using the following command: 
    wget https://github.com/ablab/spades/releases/download/v3.15.3/SPAdes-3.15.3-Linux.tar.gz 

Unpack the tar folder to access SPAdes
    tar xzvf SPAdes-3.15.3-Linux.tar.gz

Add the SPAdes script to your designated PATH (this allows the server to easily access the programme without having to manually indicate where it is)

Change directory into the folder containing the SPAdes programme and the bin directory
    cd Tools/SPAdes-3.15.3-Linux/bin

View the contents of the folder using the ls command, which should contain a number of files, including a “spades.py” script
View the full path to where the SPAdes programme is stored using the pwd command, and copy this path.
Return to the home directory using the cd command

Open your bash profile (a file containing all the settings necessary for running the different programmes in your profile)
    nano ~/.bashrc 

Scroll to the bottom of the file, above the line with a bunch of code for initializing Conda and copy this command: 
    export PATH=$PATH:/home/sam/Tools/SPAdes-3.15.5-Linux/bin
Save your changes by typing ‘Ctrl+O’ and <Enter>, then exit the file by typing ‘Ctrl+X’ and <Enter>.

To confirm that spades is running 
Refresh the bash profile
    source ~/.bashrc

Run the programme 
    which spades.py
* The path to spades should be visible if running correctly (e.g. /home/gabby/Tools/SPAdes-3.15.3-Linux/bin)

B. For the assembly of marine invertebrate metagenomes
Enter the Slurm_scripts folder using the cd command
    e.g. cd /home/gabby/Slurm_scripts

Create a new file in the Slurm_scripts folder
    nano spades_iontorrent.sh

Rename the script according to the name of the metagenome being assembled (e.g. for sample TIC2019-013N, name the script 013N_spades_iontorrent.sh),
Modify the script in to indicate the number of CPUs needed, path to the folder where your sequence reads are stored and output folder location.
- path/to/your/reads should be the full path to where the raw reads are store (e.g. /home/gabby/Assembly_directory/)
- the ‘XXX’ in IonCode_XXX_rawlib.basecaller.bam should be replaced with the filename containing your raw sequences (e.g. IonCode_0663_rawlib.basecaller.bam)

Run the SPAdes programme.
    sbatch Spades_assembly_script.sh

Check the status of the job using the squeue command.
    Squeue
